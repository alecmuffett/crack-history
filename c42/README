This is Crack v4.1, the "Sensible" Unix Password Cracker. 

- Documentation is in the directory 'Docs' - go for it... 

dicts.rules is now up to 240 entries, mostly thanks to mycroft @
gnu.ai.mit.edu; don't lose heart, its not as bad as all that...  3 weeks
of CPU isn't all that long, really...  Seriously, most of the rules
generate really small dictionaries, so it's not all that bad.  8-)

There are several additions to the dictionary rules, notably the
character class commands and the i, o, = and @ commands. 

Use of "Crack -R" (as opposed to "Crack -r") is not recommended until I
write v5.0, unless you know exactly what you're doing and why it bombs
out on you... 

Also, Crack now fully supports UFC (the latest version of which is to be
posted concurrently with Crack v4.1) - all you should have to do is
unpack the latest version of UFC into the directory

				ufc-crypt

which you should create in the Crack installation directory.  The
program should do the rest. 

Happy cracking !

Bugs as of 1 Mar 1992:-

* Crack: is known to occasionally hang during a "Crack -network" whilst
rshing from machine to machine on some architectures.  It's a persistent
problem at some sites, when Crack rsh'es to a particular machine and
stays there, and thus never calls the next machine.

FIX: mark machines that hang Crack with the "-f" option in network.conf
file, then the 'rsh' will be backgrounded and Crack will continue to the
next machine.  The tweak in Crack v4.1 to close descriptors 0->9 on all
machines (esp Apollos) may help this.

* Beta testers on DEC 5500s have reported crack-pwc crashing when
compiled with the optimiser.  This apparently doesn't happen using GCC
or when optimisation is turned off (heisenbug?)

Be warned.

* Earlyish System V type systems will have problems if the environment
variable SHELL is not set to "/bin/sh" - this is because SV will
blithely ignore the "#!/bin/sh" line and invoke a csh anyway, if thats
what you prefer.

This is probably most easily diagnosed when Crack bails out like this:

	CRACK_HOME=/your/crack/directory: Command not found.

- or similar.
